# singleton

## Description
Design Patterns in PHP: Singletons. The singleton pattern is used to restrict the instantiation of a class to a single object, which can be useful when only one object is required across the system.


## Examples

Retrieve one instance of a class:
```php
<?php

Database::getInstance();
```
