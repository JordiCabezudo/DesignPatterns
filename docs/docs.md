# DesignPatterns Docs

## Basic Designs

 * [factory](designs/factory.md): Factory method is a creational design pattern which solves the problem of creating product objects without specifying their concrete classes.
 * [singleton](designs/singleton.md): The singleton pattern is used to restrict the instantiation of a class to a single object.
